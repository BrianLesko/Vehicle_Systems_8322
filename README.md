# VehicleSystems

Contents: Written by Brian Lesko, the repository contains Matlab scripts demonstrating Vehicle Systems and control theories largely learned under the study of Dr. Levent Guvenc. 

Creation of Contents: With comments and figures, the scripts were mainly produced as project submissions for Vehicle Systems Control 8322 in contribution toward a masters thesis. While some code is built off existing blocks shared by Dr. Guvenc, the implementation of controls theory was mainly reproduced for learning purposes.

About Brian Lesko: At the time of writing, Brian Lesko is, in part, a Graduate Researcher and Teaching Associate, a Masters of mechanical engineering student, and is studying mechatronic controls theory, vehicle systems, and robotics.
